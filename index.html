      <h1 class="p1">OUR WEB PROPOSAL</h1>
      <p class="p1">
        After carefully analyzing sites like Amazon, eBay, Aliexpress, etc, we came to a conclusion that these sites are great, we can follow a lot from these while designing our own e-commerce site. But there's one big problem that needs to be addressed. In developing countries like Pakistan, we must provide a Cash on delivery option and other local payment options for the e-commerce site to be successful, just like Daraz is providing a COD option.
So this is one big problem with all above e-commerce platforms and hence with the sites hosted on such platforms. </p>
<p class="p1">We will tackle this problem by partnering up with local Courier services that will implement Cash on delivery service. We will also try to make it as cheap as possible.

Our website will be an e-commerce site that will provide basic options and facilities to the sellers as well as buyers. Plus we will keep an eye over the trends in society, e.g what payment options people prefer more. Plus we will invest a lot of time on our customer support service within our web application.

We will try to provide as many product categories and fairly unlimited storage to the sellers so that they might be able to get the most out of our e-commerce site.</p>

<p class="p1">So we will provide an e-commerce solution that will be friendly for new as well as established businesses and provide the best possible user experience to customers who opt us for online shopping.
Our site will not be hosting other's websites rather it will provide a platform where different roles will be given e.g Seller, customer , etc. So depending upon roles, our site will give controlled access to the user.

And with time, we will eventually try to grow our site into a big name in our e-commerce market by fixing bugs and making our web app more and more stable with each release.
